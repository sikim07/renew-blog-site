## Question.

Implement [strStr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/).

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

**Clarification:**

What should we return when `needle` is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when `needle` is an empty string. This is consistent to C's [strstr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/) and Java's [indexOf()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#indexOf(java.lang.String)).

### Example 1:
```
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: haystack = "", needle = ""
Output: 0
```

### Constraints: 

- `0 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 5 * 104`
- `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lower-case English characters.

## Answer.

### My Code
```js
/**
- @param {string} haystack
- @param {string} needle
- @return {number}
*/
var strStr = function(haystack, needle) {
let result = -1;
let size = needle.length;
if (needle === "") return 0;
for (let i = 0; i < haystack.length; i++) {

    ```
     if (haystack.substr(i, size) === needle) {
         return i;
     }

    ```

    }
    return result;

};
```

### String.slice()
- **Syntax**
```js
slice(beginIndex)
slice(beginIndex, endIndex)
```



- **Parameters**

    `beginIndex` : The zero-based index at which to begin extraction. If negative, it is treated as str.length + beginIndex. (For example, if beginIndex is -3, it is treated as str.length - 3.) If beginIndex is not a number after Number(beginIndex), it is treated as 0. If beginIndex is greater than or equal to str.length, an empty string is returned.


    `endIndex` (Optional) : The zero-based index before which to end extraction. The character at this index will not be included. If endIndex is omitted or undefined, slice() extracts to the end of the string. (E.g. "test".slice(2) returns "st"). If endIndex is greater than str.length, slice() also extracts to the end of the string. (E.g. "test".slice(2, 10) returns "st") If endIndex is negative, slice() is treated as str.length + endIndex. (E.g, if endIndex is -2, it is treated as str.length - 2 and "test".slice(1, -2) returns "e"). If endIndex represents a position that is before the one represented by startIndex, slice() returns "". (E.g "test".slice(2, -10), "test".slice(-1, -2) or "test".slice(3, 2)). 


- **Return Value**

    A new string containing the extracted section of the string.


- **Examples**

    **Using slice() to create a new string**

    The following example uses slice() to create a new string.

    ```js
    let str1 = 'The morning is upon us.';   // the length of str1 is 23.
    let str2 = str1.slice(1, 8);            // OUTPUT: he morn
    let str3 = str1.slice(4, -2);           // OUTPUT: morning is upon u
    let str4 = str1.slice(12);              // OUTPUT: is upon us.
    let str5 = str1.slice(30);              // OUTPUT: ""
    ```




    **Using slice() with negative indexes**

    The following example uses slice() with negative indexes.

    ```js
    let str = 'The morning is upon us.'
    str.slice(-3)      // returns 'us.'
    str.slice(-3, -1)  // returns 'us'
    str.slice(0, -1)   // returns 'The morning is upon us'
    ```



    This example counts backwards from the end of the string by 11 to find the start index and forwards from the start of the string by 16 to find the end index.

    ```js
    console.log(str.slice(-11, 16)) // => "is u"
    ```



    Here it counts forwards from the start by 11 to find the start index and backwards from the end by 7 to find the end index.

    ```js
    console.log(str.slice(11, -7)) // => " is u"
    ```



    These arguments count backwards from the end by 5 to find the start index and backwards from the end by 1 to find the end index.

    ```js
    console.log(str.slice(-5, -1)) // => "n us"
    ```



### String.substr()
- **Syntax**
```js
substr(start)
substr(start, length)
```



- **Parameters**

    `start` : The index of the first character to include in the returned substring.

    `length` : Optional. The number of characters to extract. 


- **Return Value**

    A new string containing the specified part of the given string.


- **Examples**

    ```js
    var aString = 'Mozilla';

    console.log(aString.substr(0, 1));   // 'M'
    console.log(aString.substr(1, 0));   // ''
    console.log(aString.substr(-1, 1));  // 'a'
    console.log(aString.substr(1, -1));  // ''
    console.log(aString.substr(-3));     // 'lla'
    console.log(aString.substr(1));      // 'ozilla'
    console.log(aString.substr(-20, 2)); // 'Mo'
    console.log(aString.substr(20, 2));  // ''
    ```



### String.substring()
- **Syntax**
```js
substring(indexStart)
substring(indexStart, indexEnd)
```
- **Parameters**

    `indexStart` : The index of the first character to include in the returned substring.
    
    `indexEnd` (Optional) : The index of the first character to exclude from the returned substring. 


- **Return Value**

    A new string containing the specified part of the given string.


- **The difference between substring() and substr()**

    There's a subtle difference between the `substring()` and `substr()` methods, so you should be careful not to get them confused.

    The arguments of substring() represent the starting and ending indexes, while the arguments of `substr()` represent the starting index and the number of characters to include in the returned string.

    Furthermore, `substr()` is considered a legacy feature in ECMAScript and could be removed from future versions, so it is best to avoid using it if possible.

    ```js
    let text = 'Mozilla'
    console.log(text.substring(2,5))  // => "zil"
    console.log(text.substr(2,3))     // => "zil"
    ```
    



- **Differences between substring() and slice()**

    The `substring()` and `slice()` methods are almost identical, but there are a couple of subtle differences between the two, especially in the way negative arguments are dealt with.

    The substring() method swaps its two arguments if indexStart is greater than indexEnd, meaning that a string is still returned. The `slice()` method returns an empty string if this is the case.

    ```js
    let text = 'Mozilla'
    console.log(text.substring(5, 2))  // => "zil"
    console.log(text.slice(5, 2))      // => ""
    ```



    If either or both of the arguments are negative or NaN, the substring() method treats them as if they were 0.

    ```js
    console.log(text.substring(-5, 2))  // => "Mo"
    console.log(text.substring(-5, -2)) // => ""
    ```



    slice() also treats NaN arguments as 0, but when it is given negative values it counts backwards from the end of the string to find the indexes.

    ```js
    console.log(text.slice(-5, 2))   // => ""
    console.log(text.slice(-5, -2))  // => "zil"
    ```
