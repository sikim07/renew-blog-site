## Question.

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.


### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```


### Constraints: 

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.


## Answer.

### Most Voted:

```js
const lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
  let longestStr = '';
  let currentStr = '';

  for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    let letter = s[i];
    let index = currentStr.indexOf(letter);

    if(index > -1) {
      if(currentStr.length > longestStr.length) longestStr = currentStr;
      currentStr = currentStr.slice(index + 1) + letter;
    }
    else {
      currentStr += letter;
    }
  }
  if(currentStr.length > longestStr.length) longestStr = currentStr;
  return longestStr.length;
}
```
