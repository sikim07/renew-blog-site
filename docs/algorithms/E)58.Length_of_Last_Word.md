## Question.

Given a string `s` consists of some words separated by some number of spaces, return *the length of the last word in the string.*

A **word** is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.


### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
```



### Constraints: 

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of only English letters and spaces `' '`.
- There will be at most one word in `s`.

## Answer.

### My Code:

```js
const lengthOfLastWord = (s) => {
    const arr = s.trim().split(" ");

    return arr[arr.length - 1].length;
};
```



### Most Voted:

```js
var lengthOfLastWord = function(s) {
    return s.trim().split(" ").pop().length;
};
```
